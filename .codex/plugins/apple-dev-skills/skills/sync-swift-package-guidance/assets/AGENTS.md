## Swift Package Workflow

- Use `swift build` and `swift test` as the default first-pass validation commands for this package.
- Use `bootstrap-swift-package` when a new Swift package repo still needs to be created from scratch.
- Use `sync-swift-package-guidance` when the repo guidance for this package drifts and needs to be refreshed or merged forward.
- Use `scripts/repo-maintenance/validate-all.sh` for local maintainer validation, `scripts/repo-maintenance/sync-shared.sh` for repo-local sync steps, and `scripts/repo-maintenance/release.sh` for releases.
- Read relevant SwiftPM, Swift, and Apple documentation before proposing package-structure, dependency, manifest, concurrency, or architecture changes.
- Prefer Dash or local Swift docs first, then official Swift or Apple docs when local docs are insufficient.
- Prefer the simplest correct Swift that is easiest to read and reason about.
- Prefer synthesized and framework-provided behavior over extra wrappers and boilerplate.
- Keep data flow straight and dependency direction unidirectional.
- Treat `Package.swift` as the source of truth for package structure, targets, products, and dependencies.
- Prefer `swift package` subcommands for structural package edits before manually editing `Package.swift`.
- Prefer Swift Testing by default unless an external constraint requires XCTest.
- Prefer `xcode-app-project-workflow` only when package work needs Xcode-managed SDK or toolchain behavior.
